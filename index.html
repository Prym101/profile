  <h1>Personal profile</h1>
    <p>Student number: 3491116</P>
    <p>E-mail: 3491116@student.rmit.edu.au</P>
    <p>Nationality: Australian</P>
    <p>Education: Diploma, Laboratory Technology (Pathology tests)</P>
    <p>Interests: Gardening, herbs and chilies. Documentaries: particularly those involving the human experience of individuals and groups, food and history.</P>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<br></br>

    <p>IT has become vital in most industries in Australia. The management, processing, and security of information is part of the day-to-day business of many modern businesses. From personal experience having a knowledge of the internet and how to obtain quality accurate information quickly is better than memorizing data. IT focuses on providing practical solutions to users of technology. I have a strong employment history in professional cookery and understand the quality or range of outcomes does not necessarily depend on the quality of the equipment or produce utilized, but imagination and experience can provide excellent results with limited resources.</p>
    <p>As the world becomes more automated it is the service industries that are becoming the foremost employers, and this is where IT is making a big impact. From the network and hardware through to software and onto storage, retrieval and the end user experience the computer specialists’ skills are sought after and valued by employers. Understanding how a system operates certainly makes dealing with its components and associated idiosyncrasies easier. </p>
    <p>Solving problems and puzzles are of interest to me as are building and getting things right. It appears to me from my experience with computers that the evolution of a system is always ongoing and its “use by” and relevance is often dictated by the number of users that subscribe to it. I think that the best software usually comes towards the end of a systems use. To use games an example; the programmers found the ways to get every bit of processing power out of the PlayStation 2 as the next console was put on the market. I think they had to make the newer model be able to run the older model’s software as it had become as good as the new model’s software. The overlap was necessary to ensure the take up of the new hardware.</p>
    <p>People are also a bit like software, they can evolve and improve while our hardware changes very slowly. With computers the possibilities and opportunities to improve, experience and understand our universe is far reaching and exciting.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<br></br>
<p> My ideal job would be a cloud developer where i would be involved in product development. Combining front and back end work for clients using cloud native development techniques. Learning how to get the most out of cloud services building running, monitering and scaling software.


    <h3>Skills I have</h3>
    <br></br>
      <p>Basic experience with word, excel, PowerPoint; some experience with research and evaluating quality of sources and relevance of data. </p>
      <p>An understanding of what data is and how it can be used e.g., statistics to inform on a making decision or exposing its meaning. </p>

    <h3>Skills I need</h3>
<br></br>
    <p>An example detailing technical skills required for a logistics (Truck) company.</p>
<br></br>

          <p>•	LAN, WAN</p>
          <p>•	Network security</p>
          <p>•	Networking - Switches and routers</p>
          <p>•	Software distribution tools</p>
          <p>•	End-point security (anti-virus, security patching, encryption etc.)</p>
          <p>•	Server Virtualisation</p>
          <p>•	Microsoft Windows operating systems</p>
          <p>•	Office 365</p>
<br></br>
      <p>I think I will be able to apply from what I learn and are exposed to in the IT Bachelor’s degree into learning different about systems, coding languages, skills and approaches. One size does not fit all in IT, it will be up to me completely how far I do or do get in this industry.</p>

  <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
<br></br>
  <p>I have many shortcomings which I need to address to give myself a genuine shot at this completing and excelling in this degree. The most notable is starting a project and producing work I am proud of. I generally enjoy learning anything, however I might have a bit of what is known as imposter syndrome.</p>
<br></br>
  <p>Symptoms of Impostor Syndrome include:</p>
<br></br>

            <p>•	Feeling inadequacy and self-doubt.</p>
            <p>•	Exhibiting perfectionist tendencies.</p>
            <p>•	Avoiding responsibility.</p>
            <p>•	Fearing judgment and discovery.</p>
            <p>•	Denying your own success.</p>


      <p>The website proposes solutions and help can be attained through:</p>
<br></br>

        <p>	Acknowledge your feelings.</p>
        <p>	Talk to others.</p>
        <p>	Develop a quick response plan.</p>
        <p>	Understand your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>	Overcome perfectionism.</p>
        <p>	Own your successes.</p>
    <br></br>

      <p>HTML							Systems and storage</p>
